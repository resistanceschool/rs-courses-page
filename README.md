## Editing Instructions

There are three main folders: `views`, `models`, `assets`. Everything else is config to make it a 'template' plugin.

### CSS / JS Edits

Edit the files in the `assets` folder.

The two main external libraries used are:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) used for general layout, the feature carousel, modals, and tabs
- [Slick JS](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) used for the course sliders.

### Page Edits

Edit the files in `views` folder. The main view is `views/rs-courses-page.php`. Start there. The rest of the views are `partial views`, prefixed by '_' called by this view.

### Data Model edits

Edit the files in the `models` folder. The main models are 'settings' which gathers all of the data for the page (almost like a controller in MVC) and `course` in which the DB queries reside.
